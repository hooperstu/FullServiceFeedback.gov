# GOV.UK Full Service Feedback Prototype

This project is a prototype for collecting end of service, full service feedback on any gov.uk service. 
The service allows users to provide feedback on their experience, including satisfaction, ease of use, and suggestions for improvement without falling into the trap of thinking channel specific feedback should apply to a full service.
The service also offers inroads for user researchers to conduct further follow up interviews with anyone who opts in by providing their phone number or email.
